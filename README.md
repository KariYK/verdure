# verdure

This is a prototype of the mobile app Verdure's home screen.  The prototype is based on Illustrator-based visual mockups in order to explore how the app might function when the visuals are separated into individual and grouped units. While this prototype is limited and leaves much to be desired in terms of responsiveness, it has served its purpose as a new perspective on how the visual elements interact with one another and how they should be further designed.

Verdure is a task-oriented app designed to motivate users to complete dails goals, which are metaphorized as flowers.
